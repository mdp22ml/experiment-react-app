The central tendency measures (mean=42.3, median=41.2) are close, further confirming the near-normal distribution.\n\nThe standard deviation (12.8) indicates moderate dispersion in your dataset. With 3 identified outliers, you may want to examine these values to determine if they represent measurement errors or genuinely extreme cases. Overall, your dataset appears robust with 250 samples across 7 variables, providing a solid foundation for further statistical analyses.",

Your statistical power (0.78) is approaching but slightly below the conventional threshold of 0.8, indicating a 78% chance of detecting a true effect of this size.\n\nThe confidence interval [0.8, 5.3] doesn't include zero, further confirming the significant difference between groups.

This strong positive correlation suggests that as variable A increases, variable B tends to increase as well in a fairly predictable manner.\n\nHowever, correlation does not imply causation.

The intercept (12.4) represents the expected value of your dependent variable when the independent variable equals zero.\n\nThe model's overall significance is confirmed by the high F-statistic (42.31) and very low p-value (0.0001).

This is a very good result, as it means you've captured most of the information in your data with just three components.\n\nThe first component alone explains 52% of the variance, making it the dominant pattern in your data. The second component accounts for an additional 26% of variance, while the third component contributes 13%. This decreasing pattern of explained variance is typical in PCA and suggests that you've effectively captured the most important dimensions of variation.\n\nThe Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure (0.82) indicates excellent sampling adequacy, confirming that PCA is an appropriate technique for your data. Based on these results, you could reasonably use just the first two components (explaining 78% of variance) for visualization or as input features for further modeling, significantly simplifying your dataset while retaining most of its information.",

Cluster 2 occupies a middle ground (centroid at x=45.2, y=28.7).
